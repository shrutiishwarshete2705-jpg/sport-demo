Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two
 teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball \
covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object is to manoeuvre the ball in such a 
way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. 
If a player is unable to return the ball successfully, the 
opponent scores a point.Tennis can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users

 France during the late Middle Ages.The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th
  century as lawn tennis.It had close connections to various field (lawn) games such
  as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.</p>
