        Badminton is a fast-paced racquet sport where players hit a feathered shuttlecock over a net, aiming to land it 
        in the opponent's court, played in singles (1v1) or doubles (2v2) on a rectangular court, usually indoors for 
        competitive play due to wind, with points scored by landing the shuttlecock in-bounds, and matches often played
         best-of-three games to 21 points. Governed globally by the BWF, it's an Olympic sport known for requiring agility, 
         quick reflexes, and skill, evolving from British officers in India to a global phenomenon.

         <p align="justify">Badminton is an indoor sport played by two opposing players (singles) or two pairs (doubles), who use a shuttlecock
            during a rally to try to land it on their opponents’ court or force an error. A match is played in a best-of-three
            games format. To win the match, a player must secure two out of three games, each played to 21 points. Additionally,
            a player must achieve a 2-point advantage to win a game. If that advantage is not reached, the first player to score 
            30 points wins the game. Points were awarded only to the serving side
            until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.
