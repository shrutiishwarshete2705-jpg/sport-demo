        Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport for two teams of 11 players, originating in England, where one team bats 
        to score runs (by hitting a hard ball and running between wickets) while the other bowls and fields to ge
        t batsmen out, with the game lasting hours to days and popular globally, especially in Commonwealth nations
         like India, Australia, and the West Indies. Key elements include the central 22-yard pitch with wickets 
         (stumps and bails) at each end, specialized bats and balls, and various ways to get batsmen out, like hitting 
         the wicket or catching the ball. 
         There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to hit the ball away from the wicket. 
         A hit may be defensive or offensive. A defensive hit may protect the wicket but leave the batsmen no time to run to the opposite 
         . In that case the batsmen need not run, and play will resume with another bowl. If the batsman can make an offensive hit, 
        he and the second batsman (the nonstriker) at the other wicket change places. Each time both batsmen can reach the opposite wicket,
        one run is scored. Providing they have enough time without being caught out and dismissed, the batsmen may continue to cross back 
         and forth between the wickets, earning an additional run for each time both reach the opposite side. There is an outside boundary
         around the cricket field. A ball hit to or beyond the boundary scores four points if it hits the ground and then reaches the boundary,
         six points if it reaches the boundary from the air (a fly ball). The team with the highest number of runs wins a match. Should both teams be unable to
         complete their number of innings before the time allotted, the match is declared a draw. Scores in the hundreds are common in cricket.
